## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Weekly Calculation Logic
```kotlin
// Calculate this week's expenses
val calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
val startOfWeek = calendar.clone() as Calendar
startOfWeek.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, Calendar.MONDAY)
startOfWeek.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0)
startOfWeek.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0)
startOfWeek.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0)
startOfWeek.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0)

val weekExpenses = expenses.filter { expense ->
    val expenseDate = SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy", Locale.getDefault()).parse(expense.date)
    expenseDate != null && !expenseDate.before(startOfWeek.time)
}
```

### Currency Handling
- Uses existing `CurrencyManager.getDisplayAmountFromStored()` for proper currency conversion
- Handles mixed currency expenses in weekly calculations
- Formats output using `CurrencyManager.formatCurrency()` for consistent display

### UI Layout Structure
```xml
<!-- This Week's Summary Card -->
<androidx.cardview.widget.CardView>
    <LinearLayout>
        <TextView android:id="@+id/textViewWeeklySummary" />
        <!-- Weekly expenses count row -->
        <!-- Weekly total amount row -->
        <!-- Weekly daily average row -->
    </LinearLayout>
</androidx.cardview.widget.CardView>
```
