# History Navigation Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added direct navigation from All List screen to History screen, especially useful after soft delete operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Layout Updates (`activity_all_list.xml`)
- **Added History Button**: Added a "üóÉÔ∏è History" button next to the back button in the header
- **Button Properties**: 
  - ID: `buttonViewHistory`
  - Size: 36dp height
  - Style: Accent color background with white text
  - Position: Right side of header, next to title

### 2. AllListActivity Functionality Updates
- **Navigation Method**: Added `navigateToHistory()` method to launch HistoryActivity
- **Button Setup**: Added click listener for History button in `initViews()` method
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Integrated History navigation with soft delete workflow

### 3. Soft Delete Implementation
- **Changed to Soft Delete**: Updated `performMultipleDelete()` to `performMultipleSoftDelete()`
- **Timestamp Addition**: Added deletion timestamp when marking items as deleted
- **Status Preservation**: Items are marked with `isDeleted = true` and `deletedAt` timestamp instead of being permanently removed
- **User Notification**: Updated delete confirmation dialog to mention items can be restored from History

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **History Suggestion Dialog**: After soft delete, shows dialog asking if user wants to view History
- **Informative Messages**: Updated toast messages to inform users about History functionality
- **Seamless Workflow**: Direct path from delete action to History viewing

## User Flow Improvements

### Before:
1. User deletes items from All List
2. Items are permanently removed
3. No way to restore or view deleted items from All List screen

### After:
1. User deletes items from All List (soft delete)
2. Items are marked as deleted with timestamp
3. Dialog offers to view History immediately
4. History button always available in header for quick access
5. Users can restore items from History if needed

## Benefits
- **Better UX**: Quick access to History from All List screen
- **Data Safety**: Soft delete prevents accidental permanent data loss
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless connection between delete operations and history management
- **Discoverability**: Prominent History button makes feature more discoverable

## Technical Implementation
- **Button Integration**: History button seamlessly integrated into existing header layout
- **Navigation Pattern**: Consistent with other navigation patterns in the app
