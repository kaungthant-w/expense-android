- Professional receipt footer
- Paper cutting commands

### 4. Permission Management
- Runtime permission requests for Android 6.0+
- Different permission sets for Android 12+ vs older versions
- User-friendly permission explanation dialogs
- Graceful handling of permission denials

### 5. Error Handling
- Connection failure handling
- Print failure feedback

## Technical Implementation

### ESC/POS Commands Supported
- Text alignment (left, center, right)
- Font formatting (bold, underline, double size)
- Paper cutting
- Line feeds
- Character encoding

### Data Flow
1. User selects "Print Wirelessly" in ExportActivity
2. App checks Bluetooth permissions
3. Device discovery starts, showing available printers
4. User selects a printer from the list
5. App connects to the selected device
6. Receipt is formatted based on selected paper size
7. Data is sent to printer using ESC/POS commands
8. Success/failure feedback is provided to user

### Paper Size Optimization
- **48mm/58mm**: Compact format, 3-column layout (No, Item, Amount)
- **80mm**: Standard format, 3-column layout with more spacing
- **112mm**: Wide format, 6-column layout (No, Date, Item, Amount, Description, Remark)

## Testing Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- Android device with Bluetooth capability
- Bluetooth thermal/receipt printer (ESC/POS compatible)
- Expense data in the app

### Test Steps
1. **Permission Testing:**
   - Install app on device
   - Navigate to Export screen
   - Tap "Print Wirelessly"
   - Verify permission requests appear
   - Grant/deny permissions to test handling

2. **Device Discovery:**
   - Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
   - Have a Bluetooth printer in pairing mode
   - Start device discovery
   - Verify printer appears in the list

3. **Connection Testing:**
   - Select printer from list
