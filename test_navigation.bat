echo Testing MyApplication navigation functionality...
echo.
echo Current implementation status:
echo ✅ Dark/Light mode support implemented
echo ✅ Theme-aware colors configured
echo ✅ Expense item layout updated (name + price only)
echo ✅ ExpenseDetailActivity created
echo ✅ MainActivity updated with item click navigation
echo ✅ ExpenseAdapter updated with onItemClick callback
echo.
echo Code changes made:
echo - Added activity result launcher in MainActivity
echo - Updated ExpenseAdapter constructor with onItemClick parameter
echo - Added openExpenseDetail method to pass expense data to detail activity
echo - Set layoutDetails and layoutButtons visibility to GONE in adapter
echo - Item clicks now navigate to ExpenseDetailActivity
echo.
echo Testing would verify:
echo 1. Clicking expense item opens detail activity
echo 2. Detail activity receives expense data correctly
echo 3. Save/Delete operations return results to MainActivity
echo 4. MainActivity refreshes list when returning from detail
echo.
echo Build issues encountered - likely file lock from previous processes
echo Recommendation: Restart Android Studio or use IDE to build and test
