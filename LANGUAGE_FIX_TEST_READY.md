# 🔧 LANGUAGE SWITCHING FIX - READY FOR TESTING

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES
1. **JsonSyntaxException Fixed**: Removed duplicate keys from translation files
   - Japanese file: Removed duplicate `see_less` and `expense_name_hint` keys

## 📊 MONITORING
- Logcat is actively monitoring for any errors or JSON syntax issues
- Previous errors like "JsonSyntaxException: duplicate key: add" should no longer appear

## 🔍 WHAT TO REPORT

### ❌ If Still Not Working:

- Language reverts after restart

## 📋 NEXT STEPS
After testing, I'll check the logcat output to verify no errors occurred during language switching.
