# üßæ Roller Paper Export Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you test the new roller paper size support in the expense tracking app's Excel export functionality.

## What's New
Added 4 roller paper sizes optimized for receipt-style printing:
- üßæ Roller 48mm (1.9 inch)
- üßæ Roller 58mm (2.3 inch) 
- üßæ Roller 80mm (3.1 inch)
- üßæ Roller 112mm (4.4 inch)

## Key Features

### Receipt-Style Format for Roller Papers
- **Columns**: Only 4 columns (No, Date, Name, Amount) - excludes Description and Remark
- **Font Sizes**: Smaller fonts optimized for receipt printing
  - Title: 10pt (vs 16pt for regular papers)
  - Headers: 9pt (vs 11pt for regular papers)
  - Data: 8pt (vs 11pt for regular papers)
- **Margins**: Tighter margins (0.25/0.1 inches vs 0.75/0.7 inches)
- **Column Widths**: Narrower, optimized for receipt format

### Standard Format for Regular Papers (A4, Legal, Letter)
- **Columns**: All 6 columns (No, Date, Name, Amount, Description, Remark)
- **Font Sizes**: Regular sizes for readability
- **Margins**: Standard margins for full-page printing

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Prepare Test Data
- Add at least 5-10 expense entries with:
  - Different dates
  - Various expense names
  - Different amounts
  - Some with descriptions and remarks
  - Some without descriptions/remarks

### 2. Test Standard Paper Export (Control Test)
1. Open the app and navigate to Export section
2. Select **A4** paper size
3. Choose a time period with expenses
4. Export to Excel
5. Open the generated Excel file
6. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ 6 columns present: No, Date, Name, Amount, Description, Remark
   - ‚úÖ Larger fonts (16pt title, 11pt headers/data)
   - ‚úÖ Standard margins
   - ‚úÖ All expense data including descriptions and remarks

### 3. Test Roller Paper Export (New Feature)
1. Return to Export section
2. Select **üßæ Roller 58mm (2.3 inch)** paper size
3. Choose the same time period
4. Export to Excel
5. Open the generated Excel file
6. **Verify**:
   - ‚úÖ Only 4 columns: No, Date, Name, Amount
   - ‚úÖ No Description or Remark columns
   - ‚úÖ Smaller fonts (10pt title, 9pt headers, 8pt data)
   - ‚úÖ Tighter margins
   - ‚úÖ Receipt-style appearance

### 4. Test All Roller Paper Sizes
Repeat step 3 for each roller paper size:
- üßæ Roller 48mm (1.9 inch)
- üßæ Roller 58mm (2.3 inch)
- üßæ Roller 80mm (3.1 inch)
- üßæ Roller 112mm (4.4 inch)

**Expected**: All should produce the same receipt-style format with 4 columns only.

### 5. Compare Side-by-Side
Open both Excel files (A4 and Roller) and compare:
- **Column Count**: 6 vs 4
- **Font Sizes**: Larger vs smaller
- **Data Completeness**: Full data vs receipt essentials only
- **Layout**: Full-page vs receipt-style

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS Indicators
- [ ] All 4 roller paper options appear in the paper size dropdown
- [ ] Roller papers show üßæ emoji in dropdown
- [ ] Roller exports contain exactly 4 columns
- [ ] Roller exports use smaller fonts throughout
- [ ] Standard papers still export with 6 columns
- [ ] Total amount calculation works correctly for both formats
- [ ] No build errors or crashes during export

### ‚ùå FAILURE Indicators
- [ ] Roller papers still show 6 columns (Description/Remark not excluded)
- [ ] Font sizes are the same as standard papers
- [ ] App crashes when selecting roller paper sizes
- [ ] Export fails or produces corrupted Excel files
- [ ] Total amount calculation is incorrect

## Troubleshooting

### If Export Fails
1. Check if there are expenses in the selected time period
2. Verify storage permissions are granted
3. Check available storage space
4. Try exporting with A4 first to isolate the issue

### If Formatting is Wrong
1. Open Excel file in different applications (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice)
2. Check if fonts are displaying correctly
3. Verify column count by scrolling horizontally

## Development Notes

### Code Changes Made
- Added 4 new roller paper options to `paperSizeOptions` and `paperSizeLabels` arrays
- Implemented `isRollerPaper` boolean detection using `selectedPaperSize.startsWith("Roller")`
- Added conditional font sizing logic
- Implemented separate column header arrays for standard vs roller papers
- Added conditional data row creation (4 vs 6 columns)
- Implemented tighter margins for roller papers
- Updated title cell merging (3 vs 5 columns)

### Files Modified
- `ExportActivity.kt` - Main export functionality with roller paper support

## Next Steps After Testing
1. If tests pass: Feature is ready for production
2. If issues found: Document specific problems and expected vs actual behavior
3. Consider adding more roller paper sizes if needed (32mm, 76mm, etc.)
4. Consider adding paper orientation options (portrait/landscape) for roller papers
