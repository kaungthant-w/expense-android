# Soft Delete History Feature - Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing procedure for the newly implemented soft delete history feature in the expense tracker app.

## Features Implemented ✅

### 1. Soft Delete System
- ✅ **ExpenseItem Model Updated**: Added `isDeleted: Boolean = false` and `deletedAt: String?` fields
- ✅ **Soft Delete Function**: `deleteExpenseItem()` marks expenses as deleted instead of removing them
- ✅ **Confirmation Dialog**: Users must confirm before deleting expenses
- ✅ **Filter System**: Main list only shows non-deleted expenses (`!it.isDeleted`)

### 2. History Page Functionality
- ✅ **History Activity**: Complete rewrite to use soft delete system
- ✅ **Load Deleted Items**: `loadDeletedExpenses()` shows only deleted expenses
- ✅ **Restore Function**: `restoreExpenseItem()` brings expenses back to main list
- ✅ **Permanent Delete**: `removeExpensePermanently()` completely removes from storage
- ✅ **Proper Navigation**: FAB menu integration with activity launchers

### 3. Activity Integration
- ✅ **Activity Result Launchers**: Proper refresh handling between activities
- ✅ **Delete from Detail**: ExpenseDetailActivity delete works with soft delete system
- ✅ **Cross-Activity Updates**: Changes in one activity refresh others automatically

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Basic Soft Delete
1. **Setup**: Open the app and add 2-3 test expenses
2. **Action**: Long press on an expense to delete it
3. **Verify**: 
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - After confirming, expense disappears from main list
   - Expense count updates correctly

### Test 2: History Navigation
1. **Action**: Tap FAB → History (calendar icon)
2. **Verify**: 
   - History page opens
   - Deleted expense(s) appear in history list
   - Each item shows "Restore" and "Delete Forever" buttons
   - Deleted timestamp is displayed

### Test 3: Restore Functionality
1. **Setup**: In History page with deleted expenses
2. **Action**: Tap "Restore" on a deleted expense
3. **Verify**: 
   - Expense disappears from history list
   - Navigate back to main activity
   - Restored expense appears in main list
   - Main list updates automatically

### Test 4: Permanent Delete
1. **Setup**: In History page with deleted expenses
2. **Action**: Tap "Delete Forever" on a deleted expense
3. **Verify**: 
   - Expense disappears from history list
   - Expense is gone permanently (check main list too)
   - No way to recover the expense

### Test 5: Delete from Detail Activity
1. **Setup**: Open an expense detail page
2. **Action**: Use delete function in ExpenseDetailActivity
3. **Verify**: 
   - Expense is soft deleted (goes to history)
   - Returns to main activity with updated list
   - Deleted expense appears in history

### Test 6: Cross-Activity Refresh
1. **Action**: Delete expenses → Go to History → Restore some → Return to Main
2. **Verify**: All lists update correctly without manual refresh

### Test 7: Edge Cases
1. **Empty History**: Navigate to history when no expenses are deleted
2. **All Deleted**: Delete all expenses and verify main list is empty
3. **Mixed Operations**: Combine create, delete, restore, permanent delete operations

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Action | Main List | History List | Storage |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Create Expense | Shows new item | No change | Added with isDeleted=false |
| Soft Delete | Item removed | Item appears | isDeleted=true, deletedAt=timestamp |
| Restore | Item appears | Item removed | isDeleted=false, deletedAt=null |
| Permanent Delete | No change | Item removed | Completely removed |

## Final Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The soft delete history feature has been successfully implemented and is ready for testing. All core functionality is working:

1. **Soft Delete**: Expenses are marked as deleted instead of removed
2. **History Page**: Shows deleted expenses with restore/permanent delete options
3. **Restore**: Brings expenses back to main list
4. **Permanent Delete**: Completely removes expenses

Users can now:
- Delete expenses (they go to history)
- View deleted expenses in history page
- Restore expenses back to main list
- Permanently delete expenses from history
- Navigate seamlessly between main and history activities

The implementation follows Android best practices with proper activity result handling, confirmation dialogs, and clean separation of concerns.
