# Character Limit Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully added character limits to Name and Description fields in both expense input pages.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. dialog_add_expense_modal.xml
- **Name field**: Added `android:maxLength="20"` 
- **Description field**: Added `android:maxLength="300"`

#### 2. activity_expense_detail.xml  
- **Name field**: Added `android:maxLength="20"`
- **Description field**: Added `android:maxLength="300"`

### Character Limits Applied:
- **Name field**: 20 characters maximum (စာလုံး ၂၀ စာ ကန့်သတ်)
- **Description field**: 300 characters maximum (စာလုံးရေ ၃၀၀ ကန့်သတ်)

### Technical Details:
- Used `android:maxLength` attribute to enforce character limits
- Limits apply to both:
  - Add Expense dialog (when adding new expenses)
  - Expense Detail page (when editing existing expenses)

### User Experience:
- Users will not be able to type more than the specified character limits
- The input will automatically stop accepting characters once the limit is reached
- No error messages needed - the limit is enforced at the input level

### Testing:
1. Open Add Expense dialog → Try typing more than 20 characters in Name field
2. Open Add Expense dialog → Try typing more than 300 characters in Description field  
3. Open Expense Detail page → Try typing more than 20 characters in Name field
4. Open Expense Detail page → Try typing more than 300 characters in Description field

**Expected Result**: Input should stop accepting characters once the limit is reached.
