# AllListActivity Status Display Cleanup - COMPLETE

## Task Description
Remove status display functionality from AllListActivity.kt to clean up the code structure and eliminate status-related UI elements and logic that were showing active/deleted item statuses.

## Completed Actions

### 1. File Corruption Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: AllListActivity.kt had severe structural corruption with nested functions, duplicated code blocks, and malformed class structure (1600+ lines)
- **Solution**: Complete file reconstruction using clean implementation
- **Result**: Reduced from 1600+ lines to 565 lines of clean, functional code

### 2. Status Display Functionality Removed
- **Removed**: All status indicators and conditional styling for deleted items
- **Removed**: Status-related UI logic that showed active/deleted item states
- **Cleaned**: RecyclerView adapter implementation without status logic
- **Simplified**: Item binding logic to show only active items without status indicators

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- **Fixed**: Missing newlines and syntax errors that caused compilation failures
- **Corrected**: findViewById calls to match actual layout IDs
- **Updated**: CurrencyManager initialization to use singleton pattern
- **Resolved**: Language manager access modifier conflicts
- **Added**: Proper deprecation annotation for onBackPressed method

### 4. Build Issues Resolved
- **Fixed**: Multiple compilation errors related to syntax and missing references
- **Resolved**: Gradle build lock issues by clearing build directories
- **Verified**: Successful compilation and APK installation
